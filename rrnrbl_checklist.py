"Legacy - N2e Engineer Checklist" sheet (Checklist_RRNRBL.xlsx) and can
write a filled copy of that exact template (Site ID/FA + Date filled in,
each row's checkbox + Comments column set from the validation results).

Design note on honesty: every row below is wired to a REAL existing check
where one exists (by 'rule' tag - see checks_node.py / checks_sector.py),
a newly-added check where the data was clearly available (EDP field rules,
MME Region, NR_SA tab, FA Code CIQ-vs-RFDS), or left 'manual' when no
reliable signal exists. Nothing here fabricates a pass.

    Mixed Mode Info — both the Primary (whichever of eNodeB/gNodeB Name
    matches 'Node to be built as') and the Secondary (the other one),
    when both exist.

    Each Mixed Mode Info ROW stands alone: 'Node to be built as' is
    always the real log/AMOS node id for that row, and the row's OTHER
    identity (Secondary) lives inside that SAME log — a Secondary is
    never a separately uploaded log. log_alias on a Secondary entry
    names which key to use against node_logs_text (always the Primary on
    the same row).

    tech is 'LTE' if that entry came from eNodeB Name, 'NR' if from
    gNodeB Name — this is a TECHNOLOGY tag, not a role tag. On a TMBB
    node both identities' bearer VLAN/IP/default-router live under the
    same log's 'Router=LTE', split only by an InterfaceIPv6/NextHop
    suffix ('1' for LTE-tech, 'NR' for NR-tech) — see
    pre_extract.extract_bearer_oam_ipv6. WHICH identity (LTE or NR) is
    Primary varies by site — confirmed opposite on two real sites
    (FCL04120: eNodeB/LTE is Primary; OKTN000082: gNodeB/NR is Primary)
    — so tech must be read off the actual identity, never assumed from
    role.

    This does NOT reuse checked_nodes (run_validation.py's own node list):
    checked_nodes only ever holds the PRIMARY name ('Node to be built as'),
    so every existing EDP check in this module (_edp_found_status etc.,
    all called with checked_nodes) has only ever looked up the primary
    node's own EDP row — a real gap confirmed on a real dual-tech site:
    HXL04147 (primary) and HXIN010147 (secondary) are two separate EDP
    rows under different SITE_NAME values, and HXIN010147's row was never
